    "The map above shows a distribution of funding that coalign with the placement of startups and supports the theory that placing your startup in big cities will heighten the chances of success. The map is interactive and shows the evolvement over time, providing the reader with easily comparable data and access to time trends. The trend shows some difference in the middle states, but overall they have always been a lot of funding in the costal states. Now we want to investigate if it is only the location that influences the funding or if outside factors such as average wage also have an impact. We suspect that is does and there we use the data 'workforce' from our other dataset  'DATA USA'. https://datausa.io"

    "\n",
    "***What went weel?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization used in the article ended up being intuitive and interactive and the overall storyline provides the reader with new information. Furthermore, we believe, there are findings in the article that would be surprising for our readers, maybe especially the ones residing outside the US. For example, the fact that several employees from startups have graduated from Standford. Overall we think that we ended up telling a good story about how startups influence their environment and how important it is to place a startup in a big city. \n",
    "\n",
    "***What is still missing and what could be improved?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the datasets did not contain a lot of closed startups ended up being a disadvantage. It has made it hard to asses what makes a successful startup, as it is hard to define success without having the opportunity to compare it with failure. Furthermore, looking into startups from a data perspective leaves a lot of gaps to be filled out, as it has been discovered that the startups are of complex size. Besides measurable values such as funding and several offices, startups are also highly based on the drive and motivation of the people involved, and sometimes it is seer preserve that keeps a startup running. This is hard to capture in data. We tried to look into the sentiment of the milestones, to capture the tendencies of some of these more soft values, but unfortunately, it did not yield any useful results and was removed again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, our data has been more suitable for analysis on a state level, which has made it harder to make valuable analyses on a city level. For further work on this article, it could be advantageous to look into more general city data and see if there could be some connection to our startup data, but again it is something that would provide more value if we had a clearer definition of what a successful startup is made out of."
