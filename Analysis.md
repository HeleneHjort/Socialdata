# Introduction 
The startup ecosystem is rapidly growing worldwide, and many countries are becoming hotspots for new businesses and innovation. Every year, about 305 million startups are created, and according to 2019 statistics, about 90% of these startups fail. As seen below, the US is the country with the highest number of startups; therefore, the US cities are the focus of this article.

Did you know that statistics show that three million new jobs were created in the United States through less than one year old businesses from March 1994 to March 2021? This means that during the Internet-driven boom from 1990 to 2000, startup firms accounted for about 70% of all new jobs in the US economy. That's right, startups have a significant impact on the cities they operate in and the people who live there. These companies not only create new jobs and spur economic growth but also contribute to the development of local communities. 


The presence of startups can attract talent and investment to a city, leading to new businesses and increased prosperity. Startups often bring new technologies and innovative solutions to existing problems, which can benefit the wider community.
The type of city can also significantly impact the success of startups. For example, cities with a strong culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, such as San Francisco and New York City, tend to have a higher concentration of startups. These cities often have a large pool of talent, access to capital, and a supportive regulatory environment, which can be essential factors in the success of startups. 
However, startups can also thrive in smaller cities and towns, especially if they are located near universities or research institutions. These cities often have lower living costs and can provide a supportive community for startups, allowing them to focus on innovation and growth.
In addition, the type of industry that a city is known for can also influence the types of startups that are successful there. For example, cities with a strong tech industry, such as Seattle and Austin, tend to have a higher concentration of tech startups. Similarly, cities with a strong manufacturing sector may have a higher concentration of startups focused on manufacturing and supply chain management.
Overall, the relationship between startups and cities is complex and multifaceted. Startups have the potential to drive economic growth, create jobs, and transform industries, but the question remains, is it the city that gives birth to startups, or do startups move to the city? And can we find in the data on startups for 1920-2010 the explanation of which factors their success (investments and funding) depends on, the city and the environment?

This article will explore this by analyzing educational background data, location, founding dates, investments, and more. Using data science and visualization, we will investigate the factors that contribute to the growth of startups in cities. Our dataset comes from various sources, including US public data, background information about founders, placement, investments, etc. By the end of this article, we hope to provide readers with a deeper understanding of the startup ecosystem in cities and the factors that make them successful.
