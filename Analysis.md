# Introduction 
The startup ecosystem is rapidly growing worldwide, and many countries are becoming hotspots for new businesses and innovation. Every year, about 305 million startups are created, and according to 2019 statistics, about 90% of these startups fail. As seen below, the US is the country with the highest number of startups; therefore, the US cities are the focus of this article. In 2023, the country with the most startups will be the US, followed by countries such as India, the UK, Canada, Australia and Germany. Diving into our data from Kaggle, we see a similar distribution. It can be seen that in our dataset there are far more startups from the US and therefore, the US cities are the focus of this article.

Did you know that statistics show that three million new jobs were created in the United States through less than one year old businesses from March 1994 to March 2021? This means that during the Internet-driven boom from 1990 to 2000, startup firms accounted for about 70% of all new jobs in the US economy. The data for this article also shows a growing trend of startups in the US over the years.

Although there is an increase in new business start-ups, not all of them survive. 80% of all startups in the US fail, with health tech and e-commerce being some of the hardest industries to succeed in. In this article, we're mainly looking at companies that are still open, as 86.5% of companies are operating.

Startup companies not only create new jobs and economic growth but also contribute to the development of local communities. Overall, the relationship between startups and cities is complex and multifaceted. Startups have the potential to drive economic growth, create jobs, and transform industries, but the question remains, is it the city that gives birth to startups, or do startups move to the city? And can we find the explanation of which factors the company's success depends on?

This article will explore this by analyzing educational background data, location, founding dates, investments, and more. Using data analysis and visualization, we will investigate the factors that contribute to the growth and success of startups in cities. Our dataset comes from various sources, including US public data, background information about founders, placement, venture capital investments, etc. By the end of this article, we hope to provide readers with a deeper understanding of the startup ecosystem in cities and unveiling the patterns and possibilities within.


# General trends across US
Looking at a map showing the location of startups across the US, you see that California and New York are two of the biggest states for startup companies in the US. California, in particular, stands out as the epicenter of the startup world.

The type of startup companies can vary significantly from state to state. For example, California has a high concentration of tech, biotech and enterprise startups. On the other hand, there are not many companies in these fields in New York, but there is a higher concentration of start-ups in ecommerce and advertising. This already shows that there are differences between states and start-ups. States like California and New York tend to have a higher concentration of start-ups, and as a new founder, there may be advantages to researching the type of environment in a city before deciding where to start your business.

There are two primary hubs of activity in California: Silicon Valley and Los Angeles. These regions are known for being home to many new and innovative companies driving the state's economy and shaping the future of technology and business. These areas are also characterized by a dense concentration of venture capital firms, incubators, and accelerators providing the resources and support startups need to grow and thrive. Silicon Valley, located in northern California, is the birthplace of many of the world's most successful tech companies, including Apple, Google, and Facebook. Los Angeles, located in the southern part of California, is known for having its unique startup ecosystem focused on industries such as entertainment, media, and e-commerce. In addition, the map of companies in CA also shows that there is a large number of companies in the biotech sector.
