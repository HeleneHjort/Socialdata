# Introduction 
The startup ecosystem is rapidly growing worldwide, and many countries are becoming hotspots for new businesses and innovation. Every year, about 305 million startups are created, and according to 2019 statistics, about 90% of these startups fail. As seen below, the US is the country with the highest number of startups; therefore, the US cities are the focus of this article. In 2023, the country with the most startups will be the US, followed by countries such as India, the UK, Canada, Australia and Germany. Diving into our data from Kaggle, we see a similar distribution. It can be seen that in our dataset there are far more startups from the US and therefore, the US cities are the focus of this article.

Did you know that statistics show that three million new jobs were created in the United States through less than one year old businesses from March 1994 to March 2021? This means that during the Internet-driven boom from 1990 to 2000, startup firms accounted for about 70% of all new jobs in the US economy. The data for this article also shows a growing trend of startups in the US.

Startups can have a significant impact on the cities they operate in and the people who live there. These companies not only create new jobs and economic growth but also contribute to the development of local communities. Overall, the relationship between startups and cities is complex and multifaceted. Startups have the potential to drive economic growth, create jobs, and transform industries, but the question remains, is it the city that gives birth to startups, or do startups move to the city? And can we find the explanation of which factors the company's success depends on?
This article will explore this by analyzing educational background data, location, founding dates, investments, and more. Using data science and visualization, we will investigate the factors that contribute to the growth and success of startups in cities. Our dataset comes from various sources, including US public data, background information about founders, placement, venture capital investments, etc. By the end of this article, we hope to provide readers with a deeper understanding of the startup ecosystem in cities and unveiling the patterns and possibilities within.
